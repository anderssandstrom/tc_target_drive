Item    Drawings OK	Description	                                Remark
1.      Yes	        Moved EtherCAT bus from EL6695 to EK1110	Cable slightly to short
2.      Yes	        Moved EtherCAT bus from EK1100 output to input	
3.      Needs update	EtherCAT bus connected wrong on technosoft drives. The technosft drives have EtherCAT input as lower conenctor and output as EtherCAT output. So to conclude just switch upper to lower.
